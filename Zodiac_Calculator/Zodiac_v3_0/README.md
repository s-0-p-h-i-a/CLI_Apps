# Zodiac Sign Calculator

**Version:** v3.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-26

This version introduces **functions** for calculation and string mapping, plus **loop-based input validation**. It represents the program’s transition from a single-block `main()` into a modular structure.

---
## Overview

The user inputs their **birth day and month**, and the program returns:

- Their **zodiac sign**
- Its **element** (Fire, Earth, Air, Water)
- Its **modality** (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable)

The program now uses functions for both numeric calculations and string conversions, making the main logic easier to follow/maintain and reducing repeated logic.

---
## Features

- Input validation with **do/while loops** until valid values are entered
    
- Functions for:
    
    - `defineMonthEnd()` → last day of each month
    - `defineSignStart()` + `defineSign()` → zodiac sign calculation
    - `defineElement()` + `defineModality()` → numeric classification
    - `defineSignName()`, `defineElementName()`, `defineModalityName()` → string output mapping

- Uses **switch** and **if/else** branches inside functions to handle conditions
    
- Decorative console output

## v2.1 → v3.0 Trajectory

This version is about **refactoring into functions** and improving input handling.

| Area             | v2.1 Approach                | v3.0 Improvements                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Input validation | Single checks, limited retry | `do…while` loops for continuous prompting            |
| Sign calculation | Month-specific hardcoding    | Generalised offset logic with function encapsulation |
| Structure        | All logic in `main()`        | Modular functions for calc + string mapping          |
| Readability      | Inline branching             | Streamlined top-down main flow                       |

## Learning Goals

This version focused on:

- Practicing **function creation and use**
- Recognising natural module boundaries in existing code
- Understanding how to reduce complexity in `main()`
- Building confidence in structuring C++ programs beyond a single block

---
## Limitations & Future Work

- Still no leap year validation
- Input still limited to integer values (`cin.fail()` handling not yet applied)
- Switches and if/else remain verbose — arrays will be a better fit in future
- Sign calculation logic works but could be simplified further with data structures

---
## Next steps:

- Introduce **`cin.fail()` handling** for invalid inputs
- Experiment with **arrays** or **structs** to reduce repetition
- Continue testing new sign calculation logic against edge cases

## About This Project

This is the **fifth version** of a beginner-friendly C++ console project. Each iteration refines structure while keeping functionality familiar, layering new programming concepts (validation, functions, arrays, etc.) one step at a time.

## Documentation Workflow & AI Assistance

All documentation in this project (README, dev logs, and code comments) is based on original notes written manually during development.

To improve clarity and consistency, AI tools are used to:

- Draft new READMEs from raw notes
- Generate dev logs tracing reasoning and changes
- Condense raw notes into concise in-code comment blocks

**All generated documentation is manually reviewed and edited.**  
This workflow prioritises **clarity**, **traceability**, and **ownership**.
